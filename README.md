# Project 2: Visual Argument / Rhetorical Collage

In this project I created an image of an oil spill under a car to emphasize the downsides of car dependence. My image also contains a qr code linking to a small, static site with some resources for learning more about the negative effects of car dependence and how we can fix these problems with good urban planning. Credits for images used which do not belong to me are stored below and in the file credits.md
